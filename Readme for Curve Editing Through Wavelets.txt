Curve editing through Wavelet Transform has been coded in MATLAB. This is to verify the outcome of the research paper:
Multiresolution Curves, In the proceedings of SIGGRAPH 94, page 261-268 ACM, New York 1994.


The Matlab coding is in the pdf file: Curve Editing Through Wavelets - MATLAB CODE
 
And the Simuation results are in pdf file: Curve Editing Through Wavelets - SIMULATIONS



ABSTRACT:
The usual curve editing operations are: smoothing a curve, editing the overall form of a curve while preserving its details and changing its fine
details while maintainig its overall sweep. A curve is edited on different scales of resolutions using reconstruction an decomposition filters.
These filters make possible to construct a multiresolution-based system. Different algorithms and mathematical relations are simulated in MATLAB,
their end results are presented and are found in conformity with the expected results.
